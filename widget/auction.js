Service records from both the original owner and seller are included along with factory owner's manuals. The car comes with a clean CARFAX report and retains all of its factory paint and panels. The Saleen alloys are wrapped in Continental Extreme Contact DWS-tuned tires with good tread remaining at all four corners. The S281 came with Saleen brake calipers clamping down on ventilated discs up front in addition to a lowered and stiffened suspension system. Inside, the Saleen treatment includes unique door sill plates, pedals, floor mats, gauge faces and an upgraded shifter. Mechanically, the car is in excellent condition and is up to date with all service. There are some minor cosmetic flaws on the car, such as a few spider cracks in the front bumper. The hood and front quarter-panel have been through a recent respray due to some fluid that leaked during transport from the car above onto the driver's side of the hood and front fender, which caused damage to the clear coat and paint. The factory convertible top cover is also included. The upholstery is in good condition with typical age-related creases and cracks, mostly on the driver's seat.

A fabulous car, it has 33,000 actual miles (mileage not indicated on the title). It runs and drives great and looks like new inside and out. It's equipped with a 4.0-liter engine with automatic transmission. As an adult, Shirley Temple Black was named United States ambassador to Ghana and Czechoslovakia and also served as Chief of Protocol of the United States. This car also comes with the diplomat flags for the car when it drove in and out of the embassy and was driven on official business. Temple was the recipient of many awards and honors including a special Juvenile Academy Award, the Life Achievement Award from the American Center of Films for Children, the National Board of Review Career Achievement Award, Kennedy Center Honors, and the Screen Actors Guild Life Achievement Award. On September 11, 2002, a life-size bronze statue of the child Temple by sculptor Nijel Binns was erected on the Fox Studio lot. On March 14, 1935, Shirley left her footprints and handprints in the wet cement at the forecourt of Grauman's Chinese Theatre in Hollywood. She was the Grand Marshal of the New Year's Day Rose Parade in Pasadena, California three times in 1939, 1989, and 1999.

There the car had a complete mechanical and cosmetic restoration. After the restoration the car went through a long period of storage.

It was available on a variety of body styles, including 4-door sedans, 2-door sport coupes and convertibles. By 1967, the SS 396 was the only Chevelle available with a high-performance big block, and most Malibus came with a 283ci small block. However, Chevrolet produced a handful of Malibus with the L30 engine option, allowing buyers to have a 327/275hp small block instead. This Malibu has undergone a full restoration. Finished in the original color combination of Deep Water Blue with blue interior and white convertible top, the engine bay and underside are nicely detailed to match the level of the rest of the car. It retains its original 327ci engine with M20 4-speed manual transmission. Only a small percentage of Malibus left the factory in this color combination, and even fewer convertibles had the 4-speed manual transmission.

Chevrolet has established a new performance benchmark with the introduction of the 2018 Camaro ZL1 1LE — the most track-capable Camaro ever. Taking the track-focused 1LE formula to an unprecedented level, the ZL1 1LE incorporates racing-based suspension and aero technologies, as well as exclusive Goodyear Eagle F1 Supercar 3R summer-only tires, in an extreme track performance package. In preliminary testing, the new ZL1 1LE was three seconds faster than the standard ZL1 Coupe around General Motors' 2.9-mile, 18-turn Milford Road Course test track. The improved track performance is driven by four key elements: aerodynamics, adjustable suspension, wheels and tires, and lighter weight. New aero features include a carbon-fiber rear wing, specific air deflectors and dive planes on the front fascia produce grip-generating downforce to help the car stick harder and drive faster in turns. The ZL1 1LE features racing-derived, lightweight Multimatic DSSV® (Dynamic Suspension Spool Valve) dampers front and rear for exceptional wheel and vehicle control. The front-end ride height is adjustable with the front dampers, which are used with all-new, adjustable camber plates. The rear stabilizer bar also offers three-way adjustability. All of the components are designed for quick changes at the track for optimal performance and a quick return to street settings when the track day ends. New, lightweight forged-aluminum wheels are an inch wider but an inch smaller in diameter, front and rear, than standard ZL1 wheels and are used with new Goodyear Eagle F1 Supercar 3R tires that deliver max lateral grip of 1.10g. Developed exclusively for the Camaro ZL1 1LE, the 3R tires are designed to warm up faster to help maintain more consistent grip and speed, lap after lap. The overall footprint grows approximately 10 percent over the ZL1, but the wheel-and-tire package weighs about 1.5 pounds (3.3 kg) less per corner. The lighter wheels and dampers, along with reduced thickness rear glass and a fixed-back rear seat, contribute to an approximately 60-pound (27 kg) lower curb weight than a standard ZL1 coupe. The power behind the ZL1 1LE is the 650hp, supercharged LT4 engine backed by a 6-speed manual transmission featuring Active Rev Match. Brembo brakes, including red calipers with the 1LE logo, are also included. Additional standard features include dual-zone automatic climate control, Bose premium audio system, heated/ventilated front seats and heated steering wheel.\n\n\n**100 PERCENT OF HAMMER PRICE TO BENEFIT UNITED WAY**\n**WILL BE SOLD AT APPROXIMATELY 5:30 P.M.

At its foundation, the chassis is equipped with RideTech air suspension including Shockwave aluminum air shocks all around and braking is via General Motors disc brakes. The powertrain was updated to match, with a powerful 5.3-liter LS V8 engine liberated from a 2007 GMC Denali. A GM 4L60E overdrive automatic transmission provides cruising ease. This sleek Cadillac body was subtly tweaked to perfection with the rear-fender skirts eliminated and the rear quarters modified to fill in the area formerly occupied by the skirts. New chrome-plated brass moldings were custom-fabricated for the lower reveal. The striking two-tone Mediterranean Sea Blue and Pearl custom paint finish was applied by Ron Morfitt using top-quality BASF products. The body mods and final assembly were performed by Restorations & Reproductions and the chrome plating was handled by Sherm's and Oregon Plating. The one-off white custom interior and parade boot were trimmed and installed by Jim Griffin, the seven-time Ridler Award winner. The instrument panel was redone by Classic Instruments of Boyne City, MI, and the one-off wheels and hubcaps were supplied by EVOD Industries. Continuing the seaside theme of Cadalina, Palm tree motifs are embossed into the leather upholstery and machined into the custom wheels and their center caps. A stunning custom Cadillac in every respect, Cadalina is ready to drive and enjoy.","marketing_desc":"1962 CADILLAC CUSTOM CONVERTIBLE \"CADALINA\"","reserve_type":"No Reserve","images":[{"$id":"2260","fullsize_url":"https://cdn.barrett-jackson.com/staging/carlist/items/Fullsize/Cars/205950/205950_Front_3-4_Web.jpg","thumbnail_url":"https://cdn.barrett-jackson.com/staging/carlist/items/Thumbnails/Cars/205950/205950_Front_3-4_T.jpg","fullsize_md5":null,"thumbnail_md5":null,"changed":"2/14/2017 5:27:39 PM"},{"$id":"2261","fullsize_url":"https://cdn.barrett-jackson.com/staging/carlist/items/Fullsize/Cars/205950/205950_Rear_3-4_Web.jpg","thumbnail_url":"https://cdn.barrett-jackson.com/staging/carlist/items/Thumbnails/Cars/205950/205950_Rear_3-4_T.jpg","fullsize_md5":null,"thumbnail_md5":null,"changed":"2/14/2017 5:27:32 PM"},{"$id":"2262","fullsize_url":"https://cdn.barrett-jackson.com/staging/carlist/items/Fullsize/Cars/205950/205950_Engine_Web.jpg","thumbnail_url":"https://cdn.barrett-jackson.com/staging/carlist/items/Thumbnails/Cars/205950/205950_Engine_T.jpg","fullsize_md5":null,"thumbnail_md5":null,"changed":"2/14/2017 5:27:20 PM"},{"$id":"2263","fullsize_url":"https://cdn.barrett-jackson.com/staging/carlist/items/Fullsize/Cars/205950/205950_Interior_Web.jpg","thumbnail_url":"https://cdn.barrett-jackson.com/staging/carlist/items/Thumbnails/Cars/205950/205950_Interior_T.jpg","fullsize_md5":null,"thumbnail_md5":null,"changed":"2/14/2017 5:27:24 PM"},{"$id":"2264","fullsize_url":"https://cdn.barrett-jackson.com/staging/carlist/items/Fullsize/Cars/205950/205950_Side_Profile_Web.jpg","thumbnail_url":"https://cdn.barrett-jackson.com/staging/carlist/items/Thumbnails/Cars/205950/205950_Side_Profile_T.jpg","fullsize_md5":null,"thumbnail_md5":null,"changed":"2/14/2017 5:27:28 PM"}],"targetdate":"2017-04-08T11:00:00","price":"","salestatus":"Available","vin":"62F044903","consignmentid":104088},{"$id":"2265","id":"6e0e6f11-e18e-46a4-b63b-00b9ba8e9c22","auctionid":"38b5b150-5959-4220-853e-efc163d92476","lotnumber":672.10,"year":"1932","make":"FORD","model":"","style":"DEUCE CUSTOM CONVERTIBLE","engine":"502CI","transmission":"6-SPEED MANUAL","cylinders":"8","exterior_color":"RED","interior_color":"TAN","short_desc":"Known as \"Fireball,\" this all-steel 1932 Deuce spent 20 years with its previous owner before it was built into what it is today.

This is no GM crate engine. The engine was built by Turnkey Engineering. The one-piece sheet-metal cowl hood feeds cold air into the LS7427, nestled 2.5\" rearward in the engine bay. All wires and sensors are cleverly hidden, for an uncluttered look. The shaved firewall, wraparound engine bay covers and inner fenders were modified for removal. A finished trunk lid with billet hinges and billet hood hinges round out the jewelry box. The car's appearance has been updated and all chrome removed. Handmade steel fills the gaps allowing a modern look. The overall effect is a thoroughly modern update to this Camaro's classic shape. To clean up the greenhouse, all the trim molding was shaved. Utilizing the stock front and rear glass each retain the factory shape. Additionally, the front fenders were extended to the base of the windshield. The clunky factory door handles were swapped out in favor of sleek and functional C-4 Corvette openers. The stock rear wing was modified and laid back to optimize the drag coefficient without compromising downforce. Frenched rear bumper, flush mounted exhaust tips and custom fuel filler cap each complete the look. A bespoke interior combines luxury high-touch services and high-tech accouterments. The entry path is illuminated by LED under door lights. The hand-cut and stitched glove leather covers the interior panels and TMI prototype seats. Dash, headliner, rear package tray and interior accents are trimmed in natural suede and billet aluminum. The cabin is fully Dynamatted throughout. The Marquez dash was modified to accommodate a full complement of Classic Instruments gauges. The center stack houses a USB/iPhone/iPod-compatible Pioneer DVD receiver with backup camera. Arc Audio amplifiers and speakers, as well as LED interior lighting, round out the package. The finished trunk interior matches the main cabin complete with aluminum black plate for custom engraving. The dual-adjustable Viking coilovers and Hotchkiss front tubular control arms hold 2\" drop spindles for a lower ride and improved geometry. It has SSBC 8-piston front calipers and 13\" Big Bite rotors up front. Bringing up the rear are R1 Big Bore calipers, integrated parking brakes and 12.8\" Big Bite cross-drilled rear rotors. Stainless-steel brake lines, an SSBC combo master cylinder with hidden lines and stainless-steel flex hoses round out the package.","marketing_desc":"1968 CHEVROLET CAMARO CUSTOM COUPE","reserve_type":"No Reserve","images":[{"$id":"2279","fullsize_url":"https://cdn.barrett-jackson.com/staging/carlist/items/Fullsize/Cars/205801/205801_Front_3-4_Web.jpg","thumbnail_url":"https://cdn.barrett-jackson.com/staging/carlist/items/Thumbnails/Cars/205801/205801_Front_3-4_T.jpg","fullsize_md5":null,"thumbnail_md5":null,"changed":"2/3/2017 12:02:12 PM"},{"$id":"2280","fullsize_url":"https://cdn.barrett-jackson.com/staging/carlist/items/Fullsize/Cars/205801/205801_Rear_3-4_Web.jpg","thumbnail_url":"https://cdn.barrett-jackson.com/staging/carlist/items/Thumbnails/Cars/205801/205801_Rear_3-4_T.jpg","fullsize_md5":null,"thumbnail_md5":null,"changed":"2/3/2017 12:02:10 PM"},{"$id":"2281","fullsize_url":"https://cdn.barrett-jackson.com/staging/carlist/items/Fullsize/Cars/205801/205801_Engine_Web.jpg","thumbnail_url":"https://cdn.barrett-jackson.com/staging/carlist/items/Thumbnails/Cars/205801/205801_Engine_T.jpg","fullsize_md5":null,"thumbnail_md5":null,"changed":"2/3/2017 12:02:19 PM"},{"$id":"2282","fullsize_url":"https://cdn.barrett-jackson.com/staging/carlist/items/Fullsize/Cars/205801/205801_Interior_Web.jpg","thumbnail_url":"https://cdn.barrett-jackson.com/staging/carlist/items/Thumbnails/Cars/205801/205801_Interior_T.jpg","fullsize_md5":null,"thumbnail_md5":null,"changed":"2/3/2017 12:02:04 PM"},{"$id":"2283","fullsize_url":"https://cdn.barrett-jackson.com/staging/carlist/items/Fullsize/Cars/205801/205801_Side_Profile_Web.jpg","thumbnail_url":"https://cdn.barrett-jackson.com/staging/carlist/items/Thumbnails/Cars/205801/205801_Side_Profile_T.jpg","fullsize_md5":null,"thumbnail_md5":null,"changed":"2/3/2017 12:02:02 PM"}],"targetdate":"2017-04-08T11:00:00","price":"","salestatus":"Available","vin":"124378L303850","consignmentid":103951},{"$id":"2284","id":"1117cdf3-0d63-42e7-8d8c-d335672e33cd","auctionid":"38b5b150-5959-4220-853e-efc163d92476","lotnumber":675.00,"year":"2015","make":"CHEVROLET","model":"CORVETTE","style":"Z06","engine":null,"transmission":null,"cylinders":null,"exterior_color":"BLACK","interior_color":"","short_desc":"Displayed at Barrett-Jackson in the spring of 2015, Woodward Dream Cruise, Corvettes at Carlisle August 2016 and Mid-America Corvette Funfest September 2016.

The engine is cooled by a DeWitt aluminum radiator. The transmission includes an auxiliary cooler with flexible stainless-steel lines. The front and rear axles are upgraded with new Eaton posi-traction units, bearings and seals, aluminum differential covers and stainless-steel brake lines. Five new alloy wheels with Goodyear tires complete the ride. The interior includes all-new upholstery, carpet and weatherstripping. The comfort is handled by a Vintage Air and heating system. The dashboard features factory gauges, factory tilt wheel and a reproduction AM/FM stereo. The Protect-O-Plate documents the original sale. Also included is a photo album showing the original condition at purchase in July 2015 and demonstrating the build process. It has less than 200 miles since completion in December 2016.

It was restored by a collector who specializes in restoring '40s and '50s Buicks. His previous restorations have all won AACA Jr. and Sr. awards including Best of Class at the National Buick Show. This 1956 beauty has the very rare option of factory air conditioning. A total of 4,354 convertibles were made in 1956 but only a handful were ordered with factory air. The car weighs 4,395 pounds and has a rebuilt 322/255hp V8 engine with rebuilt automatic transmission. It's capable of reaching 110 mph. The base cost in 1956 was $3,704 plus any added options. This convertible is painted original factory colors - Tahiti Coral and Dover White. The body was taken off the car and the frame was sandblasted and painted the correct semi-gloss. The car features new brake lines, new gas lines, new flushed and painted gas tank and new YNZ wiring harness. It also features new and correct exhaust and muffler system by Waldron's Exhaust as well as a top-of-the-line, correct, rebuilt carburetor, a rebuilt brake booster and a rebuilt power steering unit. No expense was spared. A flushed and re-cored radiator along with new brakes and master cylinder were also added. It has a brand-new set of NOS wheel covers and a rare and correct jack and an even more-rare GM bag for that jack. All the chrome, pot metal and stainless was professionally redone. It has new tires and all-new rubber on the entire car.

Although the overall design language has stayed the same throughout the years, each generation has its own unique features and styling to differentiate from previous years. Starting in 2005, Porsche released the 997 generation, which featured updated styling and more powerful engines. Initially it was only offered as a Carrera and Carrera S until 2006, when they released the GT3 and Turbo versions. The turbo version featured a unique front bumper with LED turn-signal trips in the air intakes and large vents, and was powered by twin-turbocharged 3.6-liter 6-cylinder engine rated at 480hp. The following year, in 2007, a cabriolet version was released that offered nearly the same performance numbers as the hardtop, a feat not often achieved with the added weight and reduced aerodynamics usually associated with cabriolets. The car was capable of 0-60 in 3.7 seconds, a mere 0.3 seconds slower than the coupe, and a top speed of 193 mph. The base price started at $137,360, but with added-on options, the MSRP could reach over $150,000. This car features special-order paint to sample, the turbocharged 3.6-liter flat-6 engine and Tiptronic automatic transmission. Just over 17,000 miles, it is loaded with many factory options, including upgraded stereo and hidden radar detector.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis particular 911 Turbo was special-ordered from the factory in light blue metallic using Porsche's premium paint-to-sample program. Complementing the paint is a dark blue leather interior and matching dark blue soft-top. The car rides on the original 19\" turbo wheels wrapped in Michelin Pilot Sport tires. The stereo has been upgraded to a Pioneer touchscreen with iPod integration, and a hidden Passport radar detector system was added. With just over 17,000 miles, this car came from an excellent collection and has been well cared for all its life. All service and maintenance has been done locally by factory technicians at the Porsche dealership. This 911 Turbo is the perfect blend of performance, comfort, luxury and style - all wrapped in a one-of-a-kind color combination.","marketing_desc":"2008 PORSCHE 911 TURBO CABRIOLET","reserve_type":"No Reserve","images":[{"$id":"2360","fullsize_url":"https://cdn.barrett-jackson.com/staging/carlist/items/Fullsize/Cars/200658/200658_Front_3-4_Web.jpg","thumbnail_url":"https://cdn.barrett-jackson.com/staging/carlist/items/Thumbnails/Cars/200658/200658_Front_3-4_T.jpg","fullsize_md5":null,"thumbnail_md5":null,"changed":"2/7/2017 1:11:34 PM"},{"$id":"2361","fullsize_url":"https://cdn.barrett-jackson.com/staging/carlist/items/Fullsize/Cars/200658/200658_Rear_3-4_Web.jpg","thumbnail_url":"https://cdn.barrett-jackson.com/staging/carlist/items/Thumbnails/Cars/200658/200658_Rear_3-4_T.jpg","fullsize_md5":null,"thumbnail_md5":null,"changed":"2/7/2017 1:11:51 PM"},{"$id":"2362","fullsize_url":"https://cdn.barrett-jackson.com/staging/carlist/items/Fullsize/Cars/200658/200658_Engine_Web.jpg","thumbnail_url":"https://cdn.barrett-jackson.com/staging/carlist/items/Thumbnails/Cars/200658/200658_Engine_T.jpg","fullsize_md5":null,"thumbnail_md5":null,"changed":"11/16/2016 1:00:02 PM"},{"$id":"2363","fullsize_url":"https://cdn.barrett-jackson.com/staging/carlist/items/Fullsize/Cars/200658/200658_Interior_Web.jpg","thumbnail_url":"https://cdn.barrett-jackson.com/staging/carlist/items/Thumbnails/Cars/200658/200658_Interior_T.jpg","fullsize_md5":null,"thumbnail_md5":null,"changed":"2/7/2017 1:11:16 PM"},{"$id":"2364","fullsize_url":"https://cdn.barrett-jackson.com/staging/carlist/items/Fullsize/Cars/200658/200658_Side_Profile_Web.jpg","thumbnail_url":"https://cdn.barrett-jackson.com/staging/carlist/items/Thumbnails/Cars/200658/200658_Side_Profile_T.jpg","fullsize_md5":null,"thumbnail_md5":null,"changed":"2/7/2017 1:12:08 PM"},{"$id":"2365","fullsize_url":"https://cdn.barrett-jackson.com/staging/carlist/items/Fullsize/Cars/200658/200658_Misc_53f3ead8-c8d1-4eb5-8af4-5ecc04035ad9_Web.jpg","thumbnail_url":"https://cdn.barrett-jackson.com/staging/carlist/items/Thumbnails/Cars/200658/200658_Misc_53f3ead8-c8d1-4eb5-8af4-5ecc04035ad9_T.jpg","fullsize_md5":null,"thumbnail_md5":null,"changed":"2/7/2017 1:13:07 PM"},{"$id":"2366","fullsize_url":"https://cdn.barrett-jackson.com/staging/carlist/items/Fullsize/Cars/200658/200658_Misc_fcee7ee1-4568-468b-8fdd-65d38f138254_Web.jpg","thumbnail_url":"https://cdn.barrett-jackson.com/staging/carlist/items/Thumbnails/Cars/200658/200658_Misc_fcee7ee1-4568-468b-8fdd-65d38f138254_T.jpg","fullsize_md5":null,"thumbnail_md5":null,"changed":"2/7/2017 1:13:29 PM"},{"$id":"2367","fullsize_url":"https://cdn.barrett-jackson.com/staging/carlist/items/Fullsize/Cars/200658/200658_Misc_cab970c5-a07c-41ad-bce0-c779b95084b4_Web.jpg","thumbnail_url":"https://cdn.barrett-jackson.com/staging/carlist/items/Thumbnails/Cars/200658/200658_Misc_cab970c5-a07c-41ad-bce0-c779b95084b4_T.jpg","fullsize_md5":null,"thumbnail_md5":null,"changed":"2/7/2017 1:13:53 PM"}],"targetdate":"2017-04-08T11:00:00","price":"","salestatus":"Available","vin":"WP0CD299X8S708061","consignmentid":100291},{"$id":"2368","id":"f32b7711-4165-4372-b6ed-8aa9ff7e0c22","auctionid":"38b5b150-5959-4220-853e-efc163d92476","lotnumber":689.00,"year":"1959","make":"CHEVROLET","model":"CORVETTE","style":"CONVERTIBLE","engine":"283CI","transmission":"4-SPEED MANUAL","cylinders":"8","exterior_color":"WHITE","interior_color":"RED","short_desc":"Fully restored California convertible with hardtop in classic Ermine White with red interior. 283/230hp engine paired with 4-speed manual transmission. 500 plus break-in miles since restoration.","long_desc":"Fully restored, this California hardtop convertible is finished in classic Ermine White with a red interior.

All the undercoating was stripped from the undercarriage, all the paint was removed and the entire body was soda-blasted. The entire car and undercarriage were painted Dodge HEMI Orange Pearl. The bottom of the car looks and shines like the top. The engine is mated to a hydraulically actuated Keisler TKO 5-speed manual transmission. The exhaust is handled by a set of custom hand-built headers with 3\" stainless-steel pipe and electric cutouts. The complete exhaust system, from the headers to the exhaust tips, is stainless steel, and the cutouts allow for adjusting the the sound. All-new glass was installed with electric windows and door locks.

This one features a 6-speed manual transmission and the $25,000 optional single-piece removable hardtop roof. January 4th, 2008 marked the end of the production for the Ford GTX1. The Ford GTX1 concept car was designed by Kip Ewing of SVT Division for the 2005 SEMA show in Las Vegas. The car was an instant hit at the show. Plans to build a limited production of the GTX1 were laid and agreed to between Ford Motor Co. and Genaddi Design Group. Clients would be able to upgrade their Ford GT Supercars into the GTX1 Roadster version at Genaddi Design Group's facilities in Green Bay, WI. A limited number of 500 GTX1s built to the customer's request, plus an additional 100 SEMA edition cars built to duplicate the car that appeared at the SEMA show in 2005, were available. Only about 100 GTX1s have been ordered and completed by Genaddi Design Group. Like the original run of the Ford GT Supercars, the build cycle for the GTX1 was, and is, limited to two years. The GTX1 was made famous by numerous magazines worldwide, countless videos and YouTube shows - and even famed car aficionado Jeremy Clarkson of the BBC TV show \"Top Gear.\" He claimed while driving the GTX1 that it was one of the best cars he had ever driven. This example has 14,970 actual miles. CARFAX shows an open recall for passenger frontal airbags.","marketing_desc":"2006 FORD GTX1 ","reserve_type":"Reserve","images":[{"$id":"2461","fullsize_url":"https://cdn.barrett-jackson.com/staging/carlist/items/Fullsize/Cars/206545/206545_Front_3-4_Web.jpg","thumbnail_url":"https://cdn.barrett-jackson.com/staging/carlist/items/Thumbnails/Cars/206545/206545_Front_3-4_T.jpg","fullsize_md5":null,"thumbnail_md5":null,"changed":"3/23/2017 4:19:34 PM"},{"$id":"2462","fullsize_url":"https://cdn.barrett-jackson.com/staging/carlist/items/Fullsize/Cars/206545/206545_Rear_3-4_Web.jpg","thumbnail_url":"https://cdn.barrett-jackson.com/staging/carlist/items/Thumbnails/Cars/206545/206545_Rear_3-4_T.jpg","fullsize_md5":null,"thumbnail_md5":null,"changed":"3/23/2017 4:20:32 PM"},{"$id":"2463","fullsize_url":"https://cdn.barrett-jackson.com/staging/carlist/items/Fullsize/Cars/206545/206545_Engine_Web.jpg","thumbnail_url":"https://cdn.barrett-jackson.com/staging/carlist/items/Thumbnails/Cars/206545/206545_Engine_T.jpg","fullsize_md5":null,"thumbnail_md5":null,"changed":"3/23/2017 4:19:15 PM"},{"$id":"2464","fullsize_url":"https://cdn.barrett-jackson.com/staging/carlist/items/Fullsize/Cars/206545/206545_Interior_Web.jpg","thumbnail_url":"https://cdn.barrett-jackson.com/staging/carlist/items/Thumbnails/Cars/206545/206545_Interior_T.jpg","fullsize_md5":null,"thumbnail_md5":null,"changed":"3/23/2017 4:19:12 PM"},{"$id":"2465","fullsize_url":"https://cdn.barrett-jackson.com/staging/carlist/items/Fullsize/Cars/206545/206545_Side_Profile_Web.jpg","thumbnail_url":"https://cdn.barrett-jackson.com/staging/carlist/items/Thumbnails/Cars/206545/206545_Side_Profile_T.jpg","fullsize_md5":null,"thumbnail_md5":null,"changed":"3/23/2017 4:19:37 PM"},{"$id":"2466","fullsize_url":"https://cdn.barrett-jackson.com/staging/carlist/items/Fullsize/Cars/206545/206545_Misc_7321bfd9-c9c7-4ef5-8b93-2c1e7a97a27a_Web.jpg","thumbnail_url":"https://cdn.barrett-jackson.com/staging/carlist/items/Thumbnails/Cars/206545/206545_Misc_7321bfd9-c9c7-4ef5-8b93-2c1e7a97a27a_T.jpg","fullsize_md5":null,"thumbnail_md5":null,"changed":"3/23/2017 4:20:56 PM"},{"$id":"2467","fullsize_url":"https://cdn.barrett-jackson.com/staging/carlist/items/Fullsize/Cars/206545/206545_Misc_5435865c-4bd2-40bf-a4a5-cc3b6e53434c_Web.jpg","thumbnail_url":"https://cdn.barrett-jackson.com/staging/carlist/items/Thumbnails/Cars/206545/206545_Misc_5435865c-4bd2-40bf-a4a5-cc3b6e53434c_T.jpg","fullsize_md5":null,"thumbnail_md5":null,"changed":"3/23/2017 4:19:19 PM"}],"targetdate":"2017-04-08T11:00:00","price":"","salestatus":"Available","vin":"1FAFP90S56Y400454","consignmentid":104582},{"$id":"2468","id":"a66b1206-9412-40aa-899e-3af3c7eb0ac5","auctionid":"38b5b150-5959-4220-853e-efc163d92476","lotnumber":707.00,"year":"1967","make":"FORD","model":"MUSTANG GT","style":"CUSTOM FASTBACK","engine":"545CI","transmission":"6-SPEED MANUAL","cylinders":"V8","exterior_color":"BLACK (RED RALLY STRIPE)","interior_color":"RED","short_desc":"Pro-Touring Mustang GT monster. 545ci V8 electronic fuel-injected engine with a Tremec T56 6-speed manual transmission.

While GM policy limited engine size for the A-body and F-body lines to 400ci, a few performance-oriented Chevrolet dealers, including Don Yenko and Fred Gibbs, knew it was possible to build almost anything. With the Central Office Production Order (COPO) process usually reserved for fleets, a request could be made for a unique and specially built car. Since the 396ci big block was already available, the 427/425hp L72 engine would be a drop-in fit for the Camaro. The resulting COPO Camaros quickly reclaimed Chevrolet's honor in Super Stock drag racing and on the street. Despite limited traction, they were capable of quarter-mile times in the low 13-second range. With simple tuning and slicks, times dipped into the 11-second range. This example is an authentic 1969 COPO Camaro in classic Hugger Orange and Ivory interior. Fully restore, it comes complete with original Protect-O-Plate package, installment sales contract, Roger Budd Chevrolet envelope package and 1969 pre-delivery inspection sheet. It's equipped with a V8 engine, Muncie 4-speed manual transmission, 12-bolt Camaro axle and correct brake booster.

A gorgeous, stunning vehicle.","marketing_desc":"1967 CHEVROLET CORVETTE 427/400 CONVERTIBLE","reserve_type":"Reserve","images":[{"$id":"2495","fullsize_url":"https://cdn.barrett-jackson.com/staging/carlist/items/Fullsize/Cars/206334/206334_Front_3-4_Web.jpg","thumbnail_url":"https://cdn.barrett-jackson.com/staging/carlist/items/Thumbnails/Cars/206334/206334_Front_3-4_T.jpg","fullsize_md5":null,"thumbnail_md5":null,"changed":"3/9/2017 8:56:04 AM"},{"$id":"2496","fullsize_url":"https://cdn.barrett-jackson.com/staging/carlist/items/Fullsize/Cars/206334/206334_Engine_Web.jpg","thumbnail_url":"https://cdn.barrett-jackson.com/staging/carlist/items/Thumbnails/Cars/206334/206334_Engine_T.jpg","fullsize_md5":null,"thumbnail_md5":null,"changed":"3/9/2017 8:56:19 AM"},{"$id":"2497","fullsize_url":"https://cdn.barrett-jackson.com/staging/carlist/items/Fullsize/Cars/206334/206334_Interior_Web.jpg","thumbnail_url":"https://cdn.barrett-jackson.com/staging/carlist/items/Thumbnails/Cars/206334/206334_Interior_T.jpg","fullsize_md5":null,"thumbnail_md5":null,"changed":"3/9/2017 8:56:16 AM"},{"$id":"2498","fullsize_url":"https://cdn.barrett-jackson.com/staging/carlist/items/Fullsize/Cars/206334/206334_Side_Profile_Web.jpg","thumbnail_url":"https://cdn.barrett-jackson.com/staging/carlist/items/Thumbnails/Cars/206334/206334_Side_Profile_T.jpg","fullsize_md5":null,"thumbnail_md5":null,"changed":"3/9/2017 8:55:54 AM"},{"$id":"2499","fullsize_url":"https://cdn.barrett-jackson.com/staging/carlist/items/Fullsize/Cars/206334/206334_Misc_8b3cc6b1-74a1-41d6-9ef0-b8fc05b4d5d1_Web.jpg","thumbnail_url":"https://cdn.barrett-jackson.com/staging/carlist/items/Thumbnails/Cars/206334/206334_Misc_8b3cc6b1-74a1-41d6-9ef0-b8fc05b4d5d1_T.jpg","fullsize_md5":null,"thumbnail_md5":null,"changed":"3/9/2017 8:56:24 AM"},{"$id":"2500","fullsize_url":"https://cdn.barrett-jackson.com/staging/carlist/items/Fullsize/Cars/206334/206334_Misc_9cdba6eb-3c47-4d4a-9ec4-f11dca2228c1_Web.jpg","thumbnail_url":"https://cdn.barrett-jackson.com/staging/carlist/items/Thumbnails/Cars/206334/206334_Misc_9cdba6eb-3c47-4d4a-9ec4-f11dca2228c1_T.jpg","fullsize_md5":null,"thumbnail_md5":null,"changed":"3/9/2017 8:56:32 AM"}],"targetdate":"2017-04-08T11:00:00","price":"","salestatus":"Available","vin":"194677S120834","consignmentid":104426},{"$id":"2501","id":"62348c8e-52dc-4506-b8f3-42e18f3f3544","auctionid":"38b5b150-5959-4220-853e-efc163d92476","lotnumber":718.00,"year":"1968","make":"SHELBY","model":"GT500 KR","style":"CONVERTIBLE","engine":"428","transmission":"6-SPEED AUTOMATIC","cylinders":"8","exterior_color":"ACAPULCO BLUE","interior_color":"BLACK","short_desc":"Classic 1968 Shelby Convertible KR500 with 428ci engine and automatic transmission. 47,000 original miles and 1,500 miles since rebuilt.

Factory Wimbledon White with black interior, documented with Marti Report.","long_desc":"By the late 1960's, Ford was losing ground in NASCAR, due to tough competition from Chrysler's legendary 426 HEMI engine. Their response was to create a HEMI-based engine over their own, the 429. In order for the engine to be approved for use in racing, it had to meet the homologation requirements and be fitted into at least 500 street cars. Eventually the decision was made that the Mustang would be the platform to house the new engine, creating the Mustang Boss 429. With the new engine being so large, the Mustang's engine bay needed to be modified to fit everything. Rather than modify the cars in-house, Ford partnered up with Kar Kraft of Dearborn, MI, to widen the engine bays and install the motors. In addition, Kar Kraft relocated the battery to the trunk and added a 3/4\" rear sway bar to help with the weight distribution in attempt to help offset the heavier weight in the nose. The cars were dramatically underrated from the factory at 375hp, but in reality put out well over 500hp. For 1969, Ford produced 857 Mustangs and two Mercury Cougars equipped with the Boss 429 package. Buyers were offered a choice of five different colors, but black was the only interior option available. The cars were rather mild in their street appearance, with the only distinguishing features being the large, fully functional hood scoop and a small \"BOSS 429\" decal on the front fenders. This 1969 Boss 429, also known as KK #1717, is one of 271 cars made in Wimbledon White and came well-equipped from the factory with options such as the Traction-Lok differential, 4-speed close-ratio transmission, power front disc brakes, deluxe interior, functional front spoiler and completion suspension. It features its original matching-numbers engine and transmission documented with a Marti Report.
